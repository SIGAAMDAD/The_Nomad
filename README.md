# Overview
_The Nomad_ is a 2D action RPG set in a post-apocalypse desert hellscape taking place in the final sane dream of a God of War going insane.

## History
The Nomad was a game I originally created in my own modified version of the Quake III Arena engine. But now it's in the Godot Engine to speed up and streamline the development process.
