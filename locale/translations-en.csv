DESERT_RIFLE_DESCRIPTION,"[p]A deep desert hunting rifle designed mainly for massive beasts. The single-shot breech loaded design of this firearm coupled with the large .50 BMG bullets makes the weapon impractical for anything other than sports.

BALLER_DESCRIPTION,"[p]A favored sidearm of many mercenaries and even wealthier citizens as a means of self-defense (in most cases).[/p]\n[p]The baller found its unique usage when someone managed to jam whatever they could find into the sidearm, making it especially formidable because one can never know what was coming out of the barrel.[/p][p]\n[/p][i][char=0022]How did you even get that in there? Buddy, that's bigger than the barrel, that ain't gonna WORKâ€”[char=0022][p][indent]- Some Guy, Somewhere[/indent][/p][/i]"

Your gun and your knife.[char=0022][/p][p][indent]- Havlic Murstar[/indent][/i][/p]"
PLASMA_SMG_DESCRIPTION,"[p]A very common weapon used by ranchers, farmers, and hired guns alike. The Plasma SMG is known for being both cheap, but also highly effective.[/p][p]\n[/p][p]It is, however, considered by many to be a warcrime because of its chemically enhanced ammunition burning the skin of its victims.[/p][p]\n[/p][p][i][char=0022]I fear not the person who uses a gun, but the person who knows the gun.[char=0022][/p][p][indent]- Raio[/indent][/i][/p]"
